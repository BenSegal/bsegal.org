<h1>Open-jaw tickets</h1>

<FONT SIZE=4>
On this page I explain open-jaw plane tickets. I love open-jaws because they can save money and some of the math behind them.

<div style="width:500px;padding:15px;"><p><h3>There are three types of open-jaw tickets</h3>

<ol>
<li value=1>Origin open-jaw: Fly A -> B, B -> C. Same destination, different origin. </li>
<li value=2>Destination open jaw: Fly A -> B, C -> A. Same origin, different destination. </li>
<li value=3>Double open jaw: Flight A -> B, C -> D. Different origin, different destination.</li>
</ol>

<div style="width:500px;padding:15px;"><h3>Detailed example of a destination open-jaw</h3>

In this example we will discuss the math behind "destination open jaw" tickets.
<p></p>

The framework is A->B, C->A: in our example we are flying Seattle to SE Asia city 1 and back from SE Asia city 2 to Seattle. 
<p></p>

One key rule for an open jaw flight is that the distance between the "missing leg" (B->C) needs to be less than both other legs of the flight (A->B and C->A). Because you are doing open jaws across the pacific ocean you are in great shape as the distance B->C is going to be much smaller than A->B and C->A. Here is a crude diagram I made for possible destination open jaws: (Note the diagram changes slightly for origin open jaws and for the double open jaw -- exercise for the reader is to draw this diagram for the double open jaw :-P). 
<p></p>

<p></p>

A = Seattle. <p></p>

B = Bangkok.<p></p>

Placing another city C that is within the green region around B will ensure that BC &#62; AB and BC &#60; AC.

<div style="width:500px;padding:15px;"><h3> So why are open jaws cheap flights?</h3>

US carriers price most international flights as roundtrip tickets. So when buying internationally most of the time it's considerably cheaper to purchase a roundtrip ticket rather than buying two oneways. (Side note: there are even cases where it is cheaper to purchase a roundtrip ticket than purchasing a oneway ticket). This is where open jaws come in! <i> When you purchase an open jaw flight you are getting the roundtrip ticket pricing for oneway tickets. More specifically you get each oneway priced at half the price of what a roundtrip would cost. </i> An example will help explain this better.

<p></p>

Example: Flying Seattle to Phnom Penh then Bangkok to Seattle is $802 together as an open jaw but booking as oneways is $597 + $873 = $1,470. Here the open jaw saves a lot of money!
<p></p>

In this example the price of the open jaw comes from:
<p></p>

1/2 * (price of a roundtrip seattle to Phnom Penh + price of a roundtrip Seattle to Bangkok).
<p></p>

(Note the prices here are from flights in September 2016)
